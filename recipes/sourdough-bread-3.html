    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>New to sourdough? My easy beginner sourdough bread recipe makes the best artisan-style loaf at home with just 5 simple ingredients: bread flour, active sourdough starter, water, salt and olive oil—my signature addition—known for creating a light, plush crumb and a crisp golden crust. Follow my clear, step-by-step instructions and video guidance to bake fresh sourdough bread with confidence (even on your first try!).</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g bubbly, active sourdough starter</li>
        <li>250g warm water (see Note 2)</li>
        <li>25g olive oil</li>
        <li>500g bread flour (not all purpose flour)</li>
        <li>10g fine sea salt</li>
        <li>fine ground cornmeal or non-stick parchment paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1: Make The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the sourdough starter, water and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix with a fork to combine, then add the flour and salt.</li>
        <li>Continue mixing until the dough becomes stiff, then squish it together with your hands to incorporate all the flour. The dough will be rough and shaggy.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap, or very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After resting, return to the bowl and work the dough into a rough ball, about 15 seconds.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 2: First Rise or Bulk Fermentation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover the bowl with lightly oiled plastic wrap. Alternatively, transfer the dough to a high-sided dough tub.</li>
        <li>Let it rise in a warm place, ideally 70-75 F.</li>
        <li>The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has almost doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Note: The bulk rise time will be different for everyone. For example, in the summer, expect ~2-4 hours @ 80 F/ 26 C. In the winter, ~10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C. Watch the dough and not the clock. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 3: Stretch & Fold The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>During the bulk fermentation, you can do a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30-45 minutes in: lift a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over itself.</li>
        <li>Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat until you’ve come full circle (1 set).</li>
        <li>Do 1-2 additional sets, spaced ~1 hour apart.</li>
        <li>Note: Dough made with 250g water will feel stiffer; 300-325g water will be more stretchy and elastic. Let it rest longer in between sets if it resists stretching.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 4: Shape The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the dough onto a lightly floured surface.</li>
        <li>Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center.</li>
        <li>Turn slightly, and then fold over the next section.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have come full circle.</li>
        <li>Flip the dough over, seam side down.</li>
        <li>Gently cup the sides and rotate in a circular motion to tighten the shape. The goal is to build surface tension to create a tight ball (too much flour will cause the dough to slide around).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 5: Second Rise or Final Proof</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Now the dough needs to rise again. If you’ve used 250g water, you can do a free-form second rise in the Dutch oven (if not, see note below). </li>
        <li>Line the pot with a piece of parchment paper (this is what I do) or coat with cornmeal.</li>
        <li>Place the dough inside, cover and let rise for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. It’s ready when slightly puffy, but not double in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450 F/ 232 C.</li>
        <li>Note: If your dough contains more than 250g water, skip the free-from rise. Your dough will spread. Instead, use a floured, cloth-lined, proofing basket to help hold its shape.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 6: Score The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Right before baking, make a shallow 2-3 inch slash (or longer) in the center of the dough using a bread lame, razor blade, or small sharp knife. The cut should be ~1/4-inch deep.</li>  
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 7: Bake The Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bread in the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400 F/ 204 C.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an another 40 minutes, until deep, golden brown. All ovens are different; feel free to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures.</li>
        <li>Check for doneness with a digital thermometer: 205-210 F/ 96-98 C for sourdough.</li>
        <li>Remove the bread from the hot Dutch oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Weigh your ingredients with a digital scale for best results.</li>
        <li>For a more soft and pliable dough, increase the water up to 300 g- 325 g total.</li>
        <li>Use a floured, cloth-lined bowl or proofing basket (instead of the Dutch oven) for the second rise.</li>
        <li>You will need a 5 1/2 or 6 quart Dutch oven for baking.</li>
        <li>This recipe was tested with King Arthur Bread Flour, Gold Medal Bread Flour, Pillsbury Bread Flour.</li>
