Description
New to sourdough? My easy beginner sourdough bread recipe makes the best artisan-style loaf at home with just 5 simple ingredients: bread flour, active sourdough starter, water, salt and olive oil—my signature addition—known for creating a light, plush crumb and a crisp golden crust. Follow my clear, step-by-step instructions and video guidance to bake fresh sourdough bread with confidence (even on your first try!). 

Ingredients
150g bubbly, active sourdough starter
250g warm water (see Note 2)
25g olive oil
500g bread flour (not all purpose flour)
10g fine sea salt
fine ground cornmeal or non-stick parchment paper
Notes, Tips & Equipment
Weigh your ingredients with a digital scale for best results
For a more soft and pliable dough, increase the water up to 300 g- 325 g total. Use a floured, cloth-lined bowl or proofing basket (instead of the Dutch oven) for the second rise.
You will need a 5 1/2 or 6 quart Dutch oven for baking
This recipe was tested with King Arthur Bread Flour, Gold Medal Bread Flour, Pillsbury Bread Flour

Instructions
Make The Dough
In a large bowl, add the sourdough starter, water and olive oil. Mix with a fork to combine, then add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until the dough becomes stiff, then squish it together with your hands to incorporate all the flour. The dough will be rough and shaggy.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, reusable wrap, or very damp kitchen towel. Let rest (autolyse) for 30 minutes to 1 hour.

After resting, return to the bowl and work the dough into a rough ball, about 15 seconds. 

Bulk Rise (First Rise or Bulk Fermentation)
Cover the bowl with lightly oiled plastic wrap. Alternatively, transfer the dough to a high-sided dough tub. Let it rise in a warm place, ideally 70-75 F. The dough is ready when it no longer looks dense and has almost doubled in size.

Note: The bulk rise time will be different for everyone. For example, in the summer, expect ~2-4 hours @ 80 F/ 26 C. In the winter, ~10-12 hours @ 68º F/ 20º C. Watch the dough and not the clock. 

Optional Step: Stretch & Fold The Dough
During the bulk fermentation, you can do a series of ‘stretch & folds’ to strengthen the dough. Start 30-45 minutes in: lift a portion of the dough, stretch it upwards, and fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl ¼ turn and repeat until you’ve come full circle (1 set). Do 1-2 additional sets, spaced ~1 hour apart. Click here for a step-by-step video tutorial.

Note: Dough made with 250g water will feel stiffer; 300-325g water will be more stretchy and elastic. Let it rest longer in between sets if it resists stretching.

Shape The Dough
Remove the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Starting at the top, fold the dough over toward the center. Turn slightly, and then fold over the next section. Repeat until you have come full circle. Flip the dough over, seam side down. Gently cup the sides and rotate in a circular motion to tighten the shape. The goal is to build surface tension to create a tight ball (too much flour will cause the dough to slide around).

Second Rise
Now the dough needs to rise again. If you’ve used 250g water, you can do a free-form second rise in the Dutch oven (if not, see note below). Line the pot with a piece of parchment paper (this is what I do) or coat with cornmeal. Place the dough inside, cover and let rise for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. It’s ready when slightly puffy, but not double in size. Preheat your oven to 450 F/ 232 C.

Note: If your dough contains more than 250g water, skip the free-from rise. Your dough will spread. Instead, use a floured, cloth-lined, proofing basket to help hold its shape. 

Score The Dough
Right before baking, make a shallow 2-3 inch slash (or longer) in the center of the dough using a bread lame, razor blade, or small sharp knife. The cut should be ~1/4-inch deep.

Bake The Dough
Place the bread in the oven on the center rack (lid on) and reduce the temperature to 400 F/ 204 C. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the lid, and continue to bake (uncovered) for an another 40 minutes, until deep, golden brown. All ovens are different; feel free to make minimal adjustments to these temperatures.

Check for doneness with a digital thermometer: 205-210 F/ 96-98 C for sourdough.

Remove the bread from the hot Dutch oven, and cool on a wire rack for at least an hour before slicing. </p>
